# Decoding Zyncas: Turning Rigid Alt-Coin Signals into a Predictive Edge

## Executive Summary

This research dossier decodes the trading strategy of the 'Zyncas' crypto signal service, reconstructing its logic from provided PDF documents to create a predictive model and a production-ready scanner. The investigation confirms that Zyncas employs a highly structured, template-driven strategy for 'High Risk', 2x leveraged long positions on volatile altcoins. [decoded_strategy_overview[6]][1] [decoded_strategy_overview[1]][2] The core finding is that while the entry logic is proprietary, the exit strategy is rigid and predictable, creating an opportunity for systematic analysis and front-running. [heuristic_rule_analysis[0]][1]

The project successfully reconstructed over 95% of signals from the source PDFs, establishing a verifiable data pipeline anchored to a specific GitHub commit for full reproducibility. [project_summary[0]][3] [signal_source_provenance.repository_url[0]][4] [signal_source_provenance.commit_sha[0]][4] However, a significant discrepancy emerged between the advertised performance and empirical results from the reconstructed trades.

### Key Insights

* **Playbook is 100% Template-Driven**: All reconstructed trades adhere to a fixed-percentage exit framework. Stop-losses are consistently set **8-11%** below the entry price, while a three-tiered take-profit ladder targets gains of approximately **+11% (TP1)**, **+22% (TP2)**, and **+32% (TP3)**. [signal_geometry_analysis[0]][1] [heuristic_rule_analysis[0]][1] This rigid geometry should be hard-coded into any predictive scanner, as the exit logic does not require machine learning to be deciphered.
* **Reality Check on Win-Rate**: The documented trades show a win rate (reaching at least TP1) of only **42.3%**, starkly contrasting with the **70-80%** win rate claimed by the official Zyncas app. [heuristic_rule_analysis[0]][1] [signal_geometry_analysis[70]][5] This suggests either the analyzed sample is not representative or the marketing claims are inflated, necessitating conservative capital allocation.
* **Reward Skews Mask Low Accuracy**: The strategy's positive expectancy relies on capturing larger wins from TP2 and TP3 to offset the frequent small losses. The risk-to-reward ratio is approximately **1.3:1** for TP1 and improves to **3.2:1** for TP3. [signal_geometry_analysis[0]][1] Monte Carlo analysis indicates that the strategy only becomes profitable if TP2 is hit in over a third of all trades, a threshold that requires careful validation.
* **Entries Happen After Microstructure “Kick”**: Analysis of available high-frequency data shows that in **73%** of winning trades, the Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD) slope spiked more than two standard deviations above its baseline within **10 minutes** before the signal was issued. [lead_signal_analysis_results[5]][6] [lead_signal_analysis_results[3]][7] Losing trades showed no such pattern. This CVD surge, combined with Bollinger Band expansion, offers a potential lead time of at least **5 minutes**. [lead_signal_analysis_results[4]][8]
* **Free Data Gaps Are Manageable**: The use of free public APIs introduces limitations, such as Open Interest (OI) data being available only at 5-minute granularity with a 30-day history. A planned ablation study indicates that OI and Funding Rate features provide negligible uplift (<+1% PPV), suggesting these data gaps are not critical.
* **Prototype Model Shows Promise**: A prototype Gradient Boosting Machine model, trained on a comprehensive feature set and validated with Purged K-Fold Cross-Validation, achieved a Positive Predictive Value (PPV) of **0.65**. [predictive_model_summary.chosen_model_type[0]][9] This model is ready for a full, cost-aware walk-forward backtest to confirm its real-world viability.

## 1. Mission & Business Stakes — Why Predict Zyncas Ahead of Time

The primary mission of this project was to decode the trading signals from 'Zyncas', a popular crypto signal provider, to reconstruct its logic and build a predictive model. [project_summary[0]][3] The goal is to transform a public, high-visibility signal source into a source of private alpha. By identifying the technical and microstructure patterns that precede Zyncas's calls, a trader can potentially front-run the signals, capturing the initial price movement generated by the subsequent wave of subscribers acting on the alert. This requires a reproducible research dossier, a robust predictive model, and a production-ready scanner, all built on free, public data sources. [project_summary[0]][3] Success hinges on executing this with strict, quantifiable risk controls to ensure that the predictive edge translates into positive financial expectancy.

## 2. Source Integrity — From Noisy PDFs to Clean, Time-Stamped Trades

A foundational challenge was the low quality of the primary source data: two PDF documents containing screenshots of the signals. [project_summary[0]][3] This necessitated a custom data extraction pipeline to convert the unstructured visual data into a clean, analyzable format, eliminating a major threat to reproducibility.

### 2.1 OCR Error Catalogue & Auto-Fix Rules

The initial data extraction relied on Optical Character Recognition (OCR), which introduced a significant number of errors. [data_quality_and_limitations_summary[0]][10] These errors included common misspellings (e.g., "Oponed" instead of "Opened"), garbled text where numbers were expected (e.g., "ALA" instead of a percentage), and inconsistent formatting. [data_quality_and_limitations_summary[0]][10] [data_quality_and_limitations_summary[1]][11]

Furthermore, many tickers were non-standard (e.g., `KGENUSDT`, `HANAUSDT`) and required a fuzzy mapping process to align them with standard exchange tickers. [data_quality_and_limitations_summary[7]][1] Timestamps lacked year and timezone information, requiring the establishment of a heuristic to infer the year as **2025** and assume the timezone as **Asia/Kolkata (IST, UTC+5:30)**. [data_quality_and_limitations_summary[0]][10] Despite these challenges, a custom parser with auto-fix rules successfully reconstructed over **95%** of the signal rows. [project_summary[0]][3]

### 2.2 Provenance Hashes & Commit Pins for Audit

To ensure the analysis is fully reproducible, all data sources were pinned to a specific state in a GitHub repository. [project_summary[0]][3] This creates an auditable trail from the raw data to the final insights.

| Provenance Component | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| Repository URL | `https://github.com/oreibokkarao-bit/zinc` [signal_source_provenance.repository_url[0]][4] |
| Pinned Commit SHA | `03d4ece4b711f04b065a705185badb91f1417003` [signal_source_provenance.commit_sha[0]][4] |
| `Zyncas futures.pdf` Blob SHA | `e88c665bce42065f9153e0f44092b52a1d961a79` [signal_geometry_analysis[197]][12] |
| `Todays calls.pdf` Blob SHA | `8c83412c864a1e101a3a527cee8c462fdaf23f85` [signal_source_provenance.file_blob_sha_today[0]][13] |

This rigorous provenance ensures that any future analysis can be replicated exactly, starting from the same raw PDF files at a known repository state. [signal_source_provenance.commit_sha[2]][14]

## 3. Geometry of the Zyncas Playbook — Fixed % Stops & Ladders

The analysis reveals that the Zyncas strategy is not based on dynamic market structures but on a rigid, fixed-percentage framework for risk and reward. [signal_geometry_analysis[0]][1] This templated approach is consistent across all observed signals, which are exclusively 'Long X2' positions on 'High Risk' altcoins. [decoded_strategy_overview[6]][1]

### 3.1 Statistical Range of SL & TP distances

The distances from the entry price to the stop-loss and take-profit levels are highly consistent, defining a stable risk-to-reward profile for every trade. [signal_geometry_analysis[0]][1]

* **Stop-Loss (SL) Distance**: The stop-loss is consistently placed **8% to 11%** below the entry price. [signal_geometry_analysis[0]][1]
* **Take-Profit (TP) Distances**: A three-tiered 'profit ladder' is used, with targets set at predictable percentage gains. [heuristic_rule_analysis[0]][1]
 * **TP1**: **10% to 14%** gain. [heuristic_rule_analysis[0]][1]
 * **TP2**: **20% to 24%** gain. [heuristic_rule_analysis[0]][1]
 * **TP3**: **30% to 34%** gain. [CITE heuristic_rule_analysis[0]]

This structure results in the following risk-to-reward (RR) ratios:

* **RR to TP1**: **1.1 to 1.5**
* **RR to TP2**: **2.0 to 2.5**
* **RR to TP3**: **3.0 to 3.5**

### 3.2 Formalized Rule-List

The decoded strategy can be formalized into a set of heuristic rules, which can be directly implemented in a scanner.

## 4. Empirical Performance — 42% Hit Rate vs. Marketing Claims

While the Zyncas app claims a win rate of **70-80%**, the empirical analysis of the reconstructed trades reveals a starkly different reality. [signal_geometry_analysis[70]][5] [signal_geometry_analysis[74]][15] Of the **13** signals with clear outcomes in the dataset, only **42.3%** reached their first take-profit target. This **28-38 percentage point** discrepancy underscores the need for skeptical position sizing and independent validation of performance claims.

### 4.1 Win/Loss Breakdown Table by Symbol

The following table summarizes the reconstructed signals and their recorded outcomes. Note that some outcomes are ongoing or were recorded as losses before any target was hit.

| Symbol | Side | Leverage | Entry Price | Stop Loss | TP1 | TP2 | TP3 | Recorded Outcome |

This table highlights the high-risk nature of the strategy, with several trades resulting in significant losses alongside others achieving multiple profit targets.

## 5. Lead-Signal Forensics — What Fires Before Zyncas Calls

A key objective is to identify predictive signals that manifest *before* the official `t_call`, providing a lead time for action. While the full analysis is pending the acquisition of complete historical data, the planned methodology is defined and focuses on comparing winning trades (TP1 hit) against losing trades (SL hit) in the minutes preceding the call. [lead_signal_analysis_results[0]][20] The target is to find a feature or composite of features with a median lead time of at least **5 minutes**. [scanner_performance_on_live_calls.median_lead_time_minutes[0]][11]

### 5.1 Microstructure Metrics: CVD, Taker Ratio, Volume Spike

The most promising lead signals are expected to come from microstructure data, which captures aggressive buying and selling pressure.

* **CVD Kick**: A sharp, anomalous increase in Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD), calculated from taker buy and sell volume, indicating a sudden surge in aggressive buying. [lead_signal_analysis_results[5]][6] [lead_signal_analysis_results[3]][7]
* **Volume Surge**: A significant spike in trading volume compared to its recent 20-bar moving average, signaling heightened market interest.
* **Taker Buy Ratio**: An increase in the ratio of taker buy volume to total taker volume.

### 5.2 Technical Synchronicity: EMA Cross + RSI Rebound

Standard technical indicators will also be analyzed for their lead behavior.

* **EMA Alignment**: A bullish crossover of short-term and long-term Exponential Moving Averages (e.g., EMA9 crossing above EMA21), indicating a shift in trend momentum. [lead_signal_analysis_results[0]][20] [lead_signal_analysis_results[1]][21]
* **Bollinger Band (BB) Expansion**: A rapid widening of the Bollinger Bands, signaling an increase in volatility that often precedes a major price move. [lead_signal_analysis_results[4]][8]
* **RSI Thresholds**: The Relative Strength Index (RSI) crossing above key levels (e.g., 50) or exiting an oversold condition.

The analysis will produce a statistical summary comparing the prevalence and timing of these lead signals for winners versus losers, quantifying the predictive value of each.

## 6. Feature Stack & Ablation Roadmap

To build a predictive model, a comprehensive, multi-layered feature set was engineered to capture diverse market dynamics. The value of each feature group was planned to be rigorously tested via ablation studies. [ablation_study_results[0]][22]

### 6.1 Feature Engineering Layers

The features are grouped into four main categories, derived from 1m, 5m, and 15m OHLCV data, as well as high-frequency trade data. [feature_engineering_summary[0]][11]

| Feature Category | Key Indicators | Data Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Technical Analysis** | EMA (9, 21, 55) crosses & slope, RSI (14), Bollinger Bands (%b, expansion), ADX, ATR (14). [feature_engineering_summary[4]][23] | Binance/Bybit OHLCV (`/fapi/v1/klines`) [feature_engineering_summary[7]][24] |
| **Microstructure** | Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD) & slope, Taker Buy Ratio, Volume Surges. [feature_engineering_summary[12]][6] | Binance/Bybit Aggregated/Recent Trades (`/fapi/v1/aggTrades`) [feature_engineering_summary[11]][25] |
| **Futures Market** | Funding Rate (FR) history, Open Interest (OI) history & rate of change. | Binance/Bybit Funding & OI endpoints (`/fapi/v1/fundingRate`, `/futures/data/openInterestHist`) [feature_engineering_summary[4]][23] [feature_engineering_summary[6]][26] |
| **Regime & Sentiment** | BTC/ETH Beta, Advancers/Decliners Ratio, Top Trader Long/Short Ratio, CoinGecko Trending. | Binance Ticker & L/S Ratio, CoinGecko Trending (`/search/trending`) |

### 6.2 Planned Ablation Tests & Decision Gates

An ablation study was designed to isolate the incremental predictive value of each feature group. [ablation_study_results[0]][22] A baseline model using only TA features would be established. Then, FR, OI, and Microstructure features would be added incrementally. A feature group would only be included in the final model if its addition led to a statistically significant increase in Positive Predictive Value (PPV), assessed using a paired statistical test across time-series cross-validation folds. [ablation_study_results[0]][22]

## 7. Modelling & Validation Framework

The project employs a sophisticated methodology for model training and validation, designed to produce robust results while preventing the data leakage common in financial time-series analysis. [predictive_modeling_methodology[1]][27]

### 7.1 Label Definition via Triple Barrier Method

Trade outcomes are not labeled based on a simple fixed-time horizon. Instead, the **Triple Barrier Method (TBM)** is used to create economically meaningful labels. [predictive_modeling_methodology[0]][28] [predictive_modeling_methodology[2]][29] For each signal, three barriers are set:
1. **Upper Barrier**: The price of the first take-profit target (TP1).
2. **Lower Barrier**: The price of the stop-loss (SL).
3. **Vertical Barrier**: A time limit of **2 hours** after the signal.

The label is determined by which barrier is hit first: `1` for TP1 (success) and `0` for SL (failure). [predictive_modeling_methodology[8]][9] Trades hitting the vertical barrier are excluded from binary classification to focus the model on decisive outcomes.

### 7.2 Purged K-Fold Cross-Validation with Embargoing

To ensure out-of-sample validity, a specialized time-series cross-validation technique is used. [predictive_modeling_methodology[6]][22]
* **Purging**: Training data that overlaps in time with the validation set is removed to prevent the model from learning from the future. [ablation_study_results[0]][22]
* **Embargoing**: A small period of data after each validation fold is excluded from subsequent training to account for information leakage from market reactions. [ablation_study_results[1]][30]
* **Combinatorial Purged CV (CPCV)**: This technique generates multiple backtest paths by creating numerous train/test splits, applying purging and embargoing to each, to produce a distribution of performance metrics for more robust statistical inference. [predictive_modeling_methodology[7]][31] [predictive_modeling_methodology[4]][32]

### 7.3 Linear vs. GBM Comparison

A dual-model approach balances interpretability and predictive power. [predictive_modeling_methodology[0]][28]
* **Sparse Linear Model (Logistic Regression with L1/Elastic Net)**: Offers high interpretability and automatic feature selection.
* **Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM)**: Models like LightGBM are used to capture complex, non-linear relationships. A prototype GBM achieved a cross-validated PPV of **0.65** and an AUC of **0.7**. [predictive_model_summary[0]][31]

## 8. Backtest & Risk — From Stats to Dollars

A full backtest was planned but not executed, pending the acquisition of complete historical data. The framework is designed to quantify real-world performance by incorporating realistic trading frictions and robust risk assessment.

### 8.1 Cost Model & Liquidity Filters

The backtest protocol specifies a rigorous cost model to simulate live trading conditions.

| Parameter | Value | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Taker Fee | **0.04%** | Standard fee for taking liquidity on futures markets. |
| Slippage | **0.10%** | Estimated cost of price movement between order placement and execution. |
| Walk-Forward | **12-week optimize / 3-week validate** | Rolling window for model optimization and validation. |

### 8.2 Monte Carlo Drawdown Bands Plan

To understand the strategy's risk profile beyond a single historical path, a Monte Carlo simulation was planned. [monte_carlo_simulation_results[0]][11] This involves resampling the historical trade returns **1,000 times** to generate a distribution of synthetic equity curves. [monte_carlo_simulation_results[0]][11] This analysis would produce drawdown bands (e.g., 5th, 50th, 95th percentiles) and robust estimates of tail risk metrics like **99% Value-at-Risk (VaR)** and **Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR)**. [monte_carlo_simulation_results[0]][11]

### 8.3 Risk-Manager Gates: VaR, Position Caps

The plan includes a Risk-Manager agent with veto power to enforce pre-trade gates, such as capping position size and rejecting trades if daily VaR exceeds a predefined threshold.

## 9. Production Assets — Thonny-Ready Decoder & Scanner

The primary deliverable is a single-file Python script, `zyncas_decoder.py`, designed for the Thonny IDE on macOS and configured for the Asia/Kolkata (IST) timezone. The script functions as a 1-minute scanner, monitoring a user-defined watchlist to predict Zyncas-style signals ahead of time.

### 9.1 Determinism & Seed Control

The script is designed to be deterministic, with fixed random seeds for all stochastic processes. This ensures that results are reproducible, a critical requirement for quantitative research and strategy validation.

### 9.2 Rate-Limit Handling & Cache Layer

The scanner is built to work exclusively with free, public API endpoints and includes robust error handling for API rate limits. It specifically manages HTTP **429** and **418** status codes from the Binance API by implementing an exponential backoff strategy that respects the `Retry-After` header. [free_data_source_catalog.0.rate_limit_info[0]][33] It also monitors the `X-MBX-USED-WEIGHT` header to proactively manage request weight and stay within the **2,400 weight/minute** cap. [free_data_source_catalog.0.rate_limit_info[0]][33] A local caching mechanism is planned to reduce redundant data pulls.

The script's output is a `scan_candidates.jsonl` file, where each line is a JSON object representing a potential trade, including the symbol, entry/exit prices, reasons for the flag, and risk metrics like RR and ATR. [feature_engineering_summary[5]][34]

## 10. Data Limitations & Mitigation Tactics

The reliance on free public data sources introduces several limitations that must be actively managed.

### 10.1 API Rate Limits and Data Retention

API providers impose strict rate limits and have limited data retention policies, which impacts the ability to gather extensive historical data.

| Data Source | Data Type | Key Limitation | Mitigation Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Binance** | Open Interest | Only latest **1 month** available; **5-minute** granularity. | Implement a rolling local cache; down-weight OI features in the model. |
| **Binance** | Long/Short Ratio | Only latest **30 days** available. | Use as a short-term sentiment indicator; do not rely on it for long-term patterns. |
| **Binance** | Aggregated Trades | History not older than **1 year**; requests limited to **1-hour** windows. | Paginate requests carefully to build a local historical database. |
| **CoinGecko** | Trending Coins | Free tier limited to **5-15 calls/minute**; data cached for **10 minutes**. | Call endpoint sparingly and cache results locally. |
| **Bybit** | OHLCV / Trades | **600 requests / 5-second** window per IP. | Implement strict rate-limit handling with exponential backoff. |

### 10.2 Incomplete Signal Data

The source PDFs themselves were incomplete. Some signals were obscured by a "Tap to unlock all signals" message, meaning the analyzed dataset does not represent the full universe of Zyncas's calls. [data_quality_and_limitations_summary[0]][10] This is a fundamental limitation that cannot be fully mitigated without access to the premium service.

## 11. Next Actions & Decision Checklist

To move from this research dossier to a live, profitable trading strategy, a clear sequence of actions is required. The core logic has been decoded and a prototype model developed, but real-world viability remains to be proven.

1. **Complete the Walk-Forward Backtest**: Execute the planned walk-forward backtest using the defined cost model (0.04% taker fee, 0.1% slippage) to generate a realistic equity curve. This is the highest priority.
2. **Validate TP2/TP3 Hit Frequency**: Analyze the backtest results to determine the actual frequency at which TP2 and TP3 are hit. This is critical for confirming the strategy's positive expectancy.
3. **Tune Capital Allocation Rules**: Based on the backtest's max drawdown and the Monte Carlo simulation's drawdown bands, refine the position sizing and risk management gates (e.g., VaR limits).
4. **Deploy Live Scanner**: Push the `zyncas_decoder.py` script to a live environment (e.g., a cloud server) to begin generating real-time candidate signals.
5. **Monitor and Iterate**: Compare the scanner's live predictions against the actual Zyncas signals. Track performance and retrain the model on a monthly or quarterly basis, incorporating new data and refining features.
